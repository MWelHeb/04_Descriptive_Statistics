# <a name="id0"></a>Descriptive Statistics - 3 days course 

During the last several years I have written - among others - a script for a three days course focusing on descriptive statistics combined with some "hands on" exercises and use cases. The script is written for a three days course and focuses content wise on following topics:

1. Introduction 
2. Displaying Descriptive Statistics
3. Calculating Descriptive Statistics
4. Measuring Concentration
5. Calculating Price Indexes
6. Correlation and Regression
7. Statistics with Excel

Needless to say that all these concepts can also be implemented straightforward by means of Python. Given that statistical concepts are also one key component of any data science project I thought it would be reasonable to provide the script for download here.
