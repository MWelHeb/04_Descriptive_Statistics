# <a name="id0"></a>Descriptive Statistics - 3 days course 

During the last several years I have written - among others - a script for a three days course focusing on descriptive statistics combined with some "hands on" exercises and use cases. Given that statistical concepts are also one key component of data science I thought it would be reasonable to provide the script for download here

Needless to say that all these concepts can be implemented straightforward by means of Python.
